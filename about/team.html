                    <h2>San Juan Capistrano Dentist Team</h2>

                    <h4>Dr. Bin Hoang - Orange County Dentist</h4>

                    <p>Dr. Hoang attended the University of California at San Diego with a Bachelor Degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 1998.

                    <p>Modern dentistry has improved in leaps and bounds with better advancements of dental technologies and clinical protocols that provides not only better, but more minimally invasive dentistry.
